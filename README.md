‚Ä¢	Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
‚Ä¢	VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like a secure tunnel between your device (like your laptop or phone) and your private cloud server.
‚Ä¢	  It encrypts all data you send and receive, so no one else can see or steal it..
‚Ä¢	Configure firewall and use Fail2Ban to prevent attacks.
‚Ä¢	A firewall is like a security guard for your cloud server, deciding which data is allowed in or out based on rules you set.
‚Ä¢	 It blocks unwanted or suspicious connections.
‚Ä¢	  Fail2Ban is a tool that watches for repeated failed login attempts
